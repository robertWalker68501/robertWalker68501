## Hi there, I'm Robert and I love to code!
I have been coding since the days of Netscape Navigator (I think I just dated myself) although in those days the coding was limited to HTML. Not sure how many people remember the days of designing and building websites using tables. Oh the headaches that caused! Then came CSS and the clouds parted and the sun was shining once again.

CSS was great but had its limitations. Once the use of media queries, variables, and the like came along it got a whole lot better. Then came SASS bringing mixins, functions, nesting, and so many other toys it was now awesome. Unfortunately during this time I did not learn JavaScript. So now I am learning as much as I can about it. When building websites in the past I would use libraries like jQuery to implement JavaScript, or find a pre-built solution. Now though I can write the JavaScript I need for my projects.


- 🌱 I’m currently learning React
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any awsome app, or website
