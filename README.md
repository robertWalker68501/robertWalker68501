## Hi there, I'm Robert and I love to code!
I have been coding since the days of Netscape Navigator (I think I just dated myself) although in those days the coding was limited to HTML. Not sure how many people remember the days of designing and building websites using tables. Oh the headaches that caused! Then came CSS and the clouds parted and the sun was shining once again.


- 🌱 I’m currently learning React
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any awsome app, or website
